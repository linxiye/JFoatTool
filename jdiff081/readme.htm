<H2>1. Purpose</H2>
<ul>
    <b>JDIFF </b> is a program that outputs the differences between two (binary) files.</br> 
    <b>JPTCH</b> can then be used to reconstruct the second file from the first file.</br>
    For example:
    <ul>
    <li><b>jdiff</b> archive0000.tar archive0001.tar archive0001.jdf
    <li><b>jptch</b> archive0000.tar archive0001.jdf archive0001b.tar</br>
    </ul>
    will create a file archive0001b.tar which is identical to archive0001.tar.
</p>
    Possible applications include:
    <ul>
    <li> incremental backups,</br>
    <li> synchronising files between two computers over a slow network (see <b>JSYNC</b>).
    </ul>
</p>
    <b>JDIFF</b> tries to find a minimal set of differences between two files using
    a heuristic algorithm with constant space and linear time complexity. 
    This means that accuracy is traded over speed. 
    <b>JDIFF</b> will therefore, in general, not always find the smallest set of differences, but will try to
    be fast and will use a fixed amount of memory.
</p>
    JDIFF does not compress the generated patchfile. It is recommended to do so with any compression tool you like.
    See below for an example using ZIP.

</ul>

<H2>3. Installation</H2>
<ul>
    On Windows systems: 
    <ul>
    <li> Compiled executables are within the "win32" directory. You can run them
    from a command prompt.
    </ul>
</p>
    On GCC/Linux systems:
    <ul>
    <li> Compiled ELF binaries are within the "linux" directory.
    <li> You may also compile the source by running "make" within the "src" directory.
    <li> Copy the resulting binaries to your /usr/local/bin. 
    <li> Within the bash directory, you can find an example BASH script, <b>JSYNC</b>, 
         which I use for synchronizing files between two computers connected 
         over a slow network.
    </ul>

        </table>
        </ul>
    <b>Principles:</b>
        <ul>
        <b>JDIFF</b> tries to find equal regions between two binary files using a heuristic
        hash algorithm and outputs the differences between both files.
        Heuristics are generally used for improving performance and memory usage,
        at the cost of accuracy. Therefore, this program may not find a minimal set
        of differences between files.</br>
        </ul>
    <b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
	<li>  Options -m and -s should be used after -b, -f or -ff.
        <li>  Accuracy may be improved by increasing the number of samples.
        <li>  Speed may be increased with option -f or -ff (lower accuracy).
        <li>  Sample size is always lowered to the largest n-bit prime (n < 32)
        <li>  Original and new files must be random access files.
        <li>  Output is sent to standard output if output file is missing.</li>
        </ul>
    <b>Important:</b>
        <ul>
        Do not use jdiff directly on compressed files, such as zip, gzip, rar, 
        because compression programs tend to increase the difference between files !
        Instead use jdiff on uncompressed archives, such as tar, cpio or zip -0, 
        and then compress the files afterwards, including the jdiff patch file.
        Afterwards, do not forget to uncompress the files before using jpatch.
    For example:
    <table>
    <tr><td><b>zip</b> -0 archive0000.zip mydir/*                        </td><td> put mydir in an archive </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>zip</b> -0 archive0001.zip mydir/*                        </td><td> some time later </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>jdiff</b> archive0000.zip archive0001.zip archive0001.jdf </td><td> difference between archives </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>zip</b> -9 archive0001.jdf.zip                            </td><td> send compressed difference file to a friend </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>zip</b> -9 archive0000.zip.zip archive0000.zip            </td><td> compress the archive before sending to a friend </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>...</td><td>  </td></tr>    
    <tr><td><b>unzip</b> archive0000.zip.zip                             </td><td> restore uncompressed zip file</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>unzip</b> archive0000.jdf.zip                             </td><td> restore uncompressed jdf file</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>jpatch</b> archive0000.zip archive0001.jdf archive0001b.zip</td><td> recreate archive001.zip</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>unzip</b> archive0001b.zip</td><td> restore mydir</td></tr>
    </table>
    You may also replace zip -0 by tar and zip -9 by gzip, or any other archiving and/or compression utility you like.
